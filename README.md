# Model4WS
Code related to project "Modeling and Simulation of a 4 Wheel Steering Vehicle".
 
Project part of the "Multibody Simulation of Mechanical Systems" course at Universit√† Politecnica delle Marche, Mechanical engineering, Mechatronics specialization.
 
The research delves into the characterization of a four-wheel steering vehicle (4WS), specifically focusing on a kinematic examination of the steering angles and the instantaneous center of rotation (ICR), alongside an optimization of the steering mechanism. Furthermore, the study investigates the vehicle's on-road dynamics, incorporating pneumatic interaction modeling and lateral force measurements. This allowed a partial optimization of the ICR position contingent upon the steering angle.
